Steal the cache access token and URL.\n2. Overflow the cache to trigger eviction of legitimate entries.\n3. Poison cache entries with malicious payloads.\n4. Achieve code execution in privileged workflows that restore the poisoned cache.\n\nThis allows lateral movement from low-privileged to high-privileged workflows within a repository.\n\n### Cache Structure\n\nIn GitHub Actions, cache scopes are primarily determined by the branch structure. Branches are considered the main security boundary for GitHub Actions caching. This means that cache entries are generally scoped to specific branches.\n\n- **Access to Parent Branch Caches**: Feature branches (or child branches) created off of a parent branch (like `main` or `dev`) can access caches from the parent branch. For instance, a feature branch off of `main` will be able to access the cache from `main`.\n\n- **Sibling Branches**: Sibling branches, meaning branches that are created from the same parent but not from each other, do not share caches. For example, two branches created off of `main` will not be able to access each other’s caches directly.\n\nDue to the above design, if something is cached in the context of the default branch (e.g., `main`), it becomes accessible to any feature branch derived from `main`.\n\n## Recommendation\n\n1. Avoid using caching in workflows that handle sensitive operations like releases.\n2. If caching must be used:\n   - Validate restored cache contents before use.\n   - Use short-lived, workflow-specific cache keys.\n   - Clear caches regularly.\n3. Implement strict isolation between untrusted and privileged workflow execution.\n4. Never run untrusted code in the context of the default branch.\n5. Sign the cache value cryptographically and verify the signature before usage.\n\n## Example\n\n### Incorrect Usage\n\nThe following workflow is caching an attacker-controlled file (`large_file`) in the context of the default branch.\n\n```yaml\nname: Vulnerable Workflow\non:\n  issue_comment:\n    types: [created]\n\njobs:\n  pr-comment:\n    permissions: read-all\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: xt0rted/pull-request-comment-branch@v2\n        id: comment-branch\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n        with:\n          ref: ${{ steps.comment-branch.outputs.head_sha }}\n      - name: Set up Python 3.10\n        uses: actions/setup-python@v5\n      - name: Cache pip dependencies\n        uses: actions/cache@v4\n        id: cache-pip\n        with:\n          path: ~/.cache/pip\n          key: ${{ runner.os }}-pip-${{ hashFiles('**/pyproject.toml') }}\n          restore-keys: ${{ runner.os }}-pip-\n```\n\n### Correct Usage\n\nThe following workflow checking out untrusted files, but the cache is scoped to the Pull Request.\n\n```yaml\nname: Secure Workflow\non:\n  pull_request:\n\njobs:\n  pr-comment:\n    permissions: read-all\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n      - name: Set up Python 3.10\n        uses: actions/setup-python@v5\n      - name: Cache pip dependencies\n        uses: actions/cache@v4\n        id: cache-pip\n        with:\n          path: ~/.cache/pip\n          key: ${{ runner.os }}-pip-${{ hashFiles('**/pyproject.toml') }}\n          restore-keys: ${{ runner.os }}-pip-\n```\n\nNote, that the example above doesn't allow using secrets if the Pull Request originates from a fork.

In case secrets are needed, `pull_request_target` with labels as `safe to test` can be used, but the code in Pull Request must be manually reviewed before applying the label.\n\n```yaml\nname: Secure Workflow\non:\n  pull_request_target:\n    types: [labeled]\n\njobs:\n  pr-comment:\n    if: contains(github.event.pull_request.labels.*.name, 'safe to test')\n    permissions: read-all\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n        with:\n          ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha}}\n      - name: Set up Python 3.10\n        uses: actions/setup-python@v5\n      - name: Cache pip dependencies\n        uses: actions/cache@v4\n        id: cache-pip\n        with:\n          path: ~/.cache/pip\n          key: ${{ runner.os }}-pip-${{ hashFiles('**/pyproject.toml') }}\n          restore-keys: ${{ runner.os }}-pip-\n```\n\n## References\n\n- Adnan Khan's Blog: [The Monsters in Your Build Cache – GitHub Actions Cache Poisoning](https://adnanthekhan.com/2024/05/06/the-monsters-in-your-build-cache-github-actions-cache-poisoning/).\n- GitHub Docs: [GitHub Actions Caching Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows).\n- Scribe Security Blog: [Cache Poisoning in GitHub Actions](https://scribesecurity.com/blog/github-cache-poisoning/).\n"},"properties":{"tags":["actions","security","external/cwe/cwe-349"],"description":"The cache can be poisoned by untrusted code, leading to a cache poisoning attack.","id":"actions/cache-poisoning/direct-cache","kind":"path-problem","name":"Cache Poisoning via caching of untrusted files","precision":"high","problem.severity":"error","security-severity":"7.5"}},{"id":"actions/cache-poisoning/poisonable-step","name":"actions/cache-poisoning/poisonable-step","shortDescription":{"text":"Cache Poisoning via execution of untrusted code"},"fullDescription":{"text":"The cache can be poisoned by untrusted code, leading to a cache poisoning attack."},"defaultConfiguration":{"enabled":true,"level":"error"},"help":{"text":"## Overview\n\nGitHub Actions cache poisoning is a technique that allows an attacker to inject malicious content into the Action's cache from unprivileged workflow, potentially leading to code execution in privileged workflows.\n\nAn attacker with the ability to run code in the context of the default branch (e.g. through Code Injection or Execution of Untrusted Code) can exploit this to:\n\n1.

A second privileged workflow with the access to repository secrets, triggered by the completion of the first workflow using `workflow_run` trigger event, downloads the artifacts and make any necessary modifications to the repository or interact with third party services that require repository secrets (e.g. API tokens).\n\nThe artifacts downloaded from the first workflow should be considered untrusted and must be verified.\n\n## Example\n\n### Incorrect Usage\n\nThe following workflow checks-out untrusted code in a privileged context and runs user-controlled code (in this case package.json scripts) which will grant privileged access to the attacker:\n\n```yaml\non: pull_request_target\n\njobs:\n  build:\n    name: Build and test\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n        with:\n          ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}\n\n      - uses: actions/setup-node@v1\n      - run: |\n          npm install # scripts in package.json from PR would be executed here\n          npm build\n\n      - uses: completely/fakeaction@v2\n        with:\n          arg1: ${{ secrets.supersecret }}\n\n      - uses: fakerepo/comment-on-pr@v1\n        with:\n          message: |\n            Thank you!\n```\n\n### Correct Usage\n\nAn example shows how to use two workflows: one for processing the untrusted PR and the other for using the results in a safe context.\n\n**ReceivePR.yml** (untrusted PR handling with artifact creation):\n\n```yaml\nname: Receive PR\non:\n  pull_request:\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - name: Build\n        run: /bin/bash ./build.sh\n      - name: Save PR number\n        run: |\n          mkdir -p ./pr\n          echo ${{ github.event.number }} > ./pr/NR\n      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2\n        with:\n          name: pr\n          path: pr/\n```\n\n**CommentPR.yml** (processing artifacts with privileged access):\n\n```yaml\nname: Comment on the pull request\non:\n  workflow_run:\n    workflows: [\"Receive PR\"]\n    types:\n      - completed\njobs:\n  upload:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    if: >\n      github.event.workflow_run.event == 'pull_request' &&\n      github.event.workflow_run.conclusion == 'success'\n    steps:\n      - name: \"Download artifact\"\n        uses: actions/github-script@v3.1.0\n        with:\n          script: |\n            var artifacts = await github.actions.listWorkflowRunArtifacts({\n                owner: context.repo.owner,\n                repo: context.repo.repo,\n                run_id: ${{github.event.workflow_run.id }},\n            });\n            var matchArtifact = artifacts.data.artifacts.filter((artifact) => {\n              return artifact.name == \"pr\";\n            })[0];\n            var download = await github.actions.downloadArtifact({\n                owner: context.repo.owner,\n                repo: context.repo.repo,\n                artifact_id: matchArtifact.id,\n                archive_format: 'zip',\n            });\n            var fs = require('fs');\n            fs.writeFileSync('${{github.workspace}}/pr.zip', Buffer.from(download.data));\n      - run: |\n          mkdir -p tmp\n          unzip -d tmp/ pr.zip\n      - name: \"Comment on PR\"\n        uses: actions/github-script@v3\n        with:\n          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n          script: |\n            var fs = require('fs');\n            var issue_number = Number(fs.readFileSync('./tmp/NR'));\n            // Verify that the file contains a numeric value\n            const contains_numeric = /\\d/.test(issue_number);\n            if (contains_numeric) {\n                await github.issues.createComment({\n                  owner: context.repo.owner,\n                  repo: context.repo.repo,\n                  issue_number: issue_number,\n                  body: 'Everything is OK.
